## Method Signatures & Classes

### src/app.py
- Loads environment variables from `.env` using `python-dotenv` at startup:
  ```python
  from dotenv import load_dotenv
  load_dotenv()
  folder_id = os.getenv("FOLDER_ID", "root")
  ```
- `GoogleDriveAPIWrapper`: Handles Google Drive API authentication and search.
- `GoogleDriveSearchTool`: Tool for searching Google Drive, used by agent.
- `GoogleDriveLoader`: Loads documents from Google Drive for ingestion/analysis.
- `initialize_agent`: Creates an LLM agent with tools and configuration.
- `OpenAI`: LLM wrapper for agent reasoning.
- All tools are now instantiated directly (not via load_tools or string names).
Update as the codebase grows.

## Schemas
- Category: `{ name: str, description: str, rules: list, subcategories: list }`
- Suggestion: `{ suggestion: str, reason: str, implemented: bool }`
- FactCheck: `{ statement: str, confidence: float, accepted: bool }`
- `.env`: Key-value pairs for environment variables (e.g., `FOLDER_ID`, `GOOGLE_ACCOUNT_FILE`).

## Algorithm Summaries
- Loads environment variables at app start so all configuration is managed via `.env`.
- Uses `FOLDER_ID` from environment, defaulting to `root` if not set.

## Areas to Add Value / Profit
- Modularize agent and synthesis logic for extensibility and analytics.
- LLM-powered suggestions and rule validation.
- Integration with external sources (Google Drive, etc.).
- Fact-checking and document creation pipeline.
- Refactor logic in `app.py` into reusable functions and modules as complexity increases.
- Add more environment-driven configuration options.
- Implement error handling for missing/invalid env vars.
- Expand documentation as new features are added.
