# Roadmap

## Status Updates
- [x] Added dotenv support for loading env vars (including OPENAI_API_KEY) automatically from .env
- [x] Updated README and requirements.txt for dotenv and troubleshooting
- [x] BlockingError (os.getcwd) async patch added for LangGraph/ASGI compatibility. All async entrypoints now robust to this dependency issue.
- [x] Migrated all schema models to Pydantic V2 (BaseModel/Field). No more v1/v2 mixing errors.
- [ ] Ensure all features using OpenAI or Anthropic keys work out-of-the-box locally and in cloud
- [x] Enhanced debug print in scripts/run_ingest.py to show key email fields with parsed text content (2025-04-24).

## Next Steps
- Confirm all modules that use OpenAI/Anthropic keys work after dotenv load
- Add further error handling for missing keys
- Continue modularizing and splitting up large files as per rules
