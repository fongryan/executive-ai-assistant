## Current Status
- [x] App loads environment variables from `.env` using `python-dotenv` (Step 2).
- [x] Fixed LangChain v0.2+ import/tooling error (google-drive-search not recognized)
- [x] Now using direct instantiation of GoogleDriveSearchTool (not load_tools)

- [ ] Refactor `app.py` into smaller, modular files as logic grows.
- [ ] Add `README.md` with setup, run, and environment instructions.
- [ ] Add tests and ensure code coverage for all features.
- [ ] Expand documentation in `.docs` and `.rules` as new features are added.

## PR FAQ (Appendix)
### What does the product do?
- Synthesizes and analyzes Google Drive documents using a modular, extensible Python app.
- Loads configuration and secrets from `.env` for flexibility and security.

### Features
- Loads Google Drive folder ID from `.env` (via `FOLDER_ID`), defaulting to `root`.
- Uses LangChain v0.2+ and Google Drive integrations for document search and analysis.
- Direct instantiation of tools, robust modular codebase.
- Designed for extensibility, modularity, and robust configuration.

### Capabilities
- Arbitrarily nested category support for dataset synthesis (planned).
- Rule generation, validation, and suggestion implementation (planned).
- Fact-checking and document creation pipeline (planned).

## Plan
1. Modularize app logic as it grows (split files, clean imports).
2. Add robust error handling and configuration validation.
3. Expand dataset synthesis and suggestion logic.
4. Implement rule and fact-checking features.
5. Maintain up-to-date documentation in `.rules`, `.docs`, `.roadmap`, and `README.md`.
